# Interactive Perturbation Visualization Tool
A preliminary interactive perturbation tool that invites users to edit input source images and better understand the attribution problem. This tool is the result of a two-month summer undergraduate research project, and could be subject to more changes in the future.

## Description & Examples
This repository contains two perturbation tools, one showing the result in the form of textual lists, the other visualizes the immediate results after perturbation with a green bar.

Textual List Results             |   Visualization of results

## Potential Improvements
* For some originally nonsquare images, the cropping transformation could be more precise. For example, the mud puppy fish from the image dataset originally came in a rectangled shape, and the current transformation crops out its head, which makes subsequent editting more inacurate.

Original Source Image         |   Image after Cropping Transformation
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
<img src="Images/OriginalFish.png" alt="Original Image" height="100" /> |     <img src="Images/CroppedFish.jpeg" alt="Image after cropping" height="100" />

* The visualization tool currently only allows users to see the interactive changes that occurs to the original class. A possible improvement would include the top five possible classes, and allow users to observe what happens to the five at the same time, instead of only at one.
