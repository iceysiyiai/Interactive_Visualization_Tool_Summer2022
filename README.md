# Interactive_Visualization_Tool_Summer2022

An interactive tool 
This interactive perturbations tool allows the user to perform 4 types of image occlusion(Complete Deletion, Grey Square, Gaussian Noise, and Gaussian Blur). After the user chooses which parts of the image they want to occlude and the type of occlusion, class predictions (from ImageNet) and confidence scores will be generated to indicated the importance of the occluded image region in the Neural Network's(resnet50) decision.
